 Stats Review Notes
 This note is summarized according to Statistical Inference by George Casella et al. The content incluedes some basic knowledge and some intuitive understanding from other people's explanation. The notes is more about the structure of these chapters and include some of the understanding and intuitions behind some of theorems and definitions. I must say that some ideas are copied from other people's answer so it's in the form of screenshots. But personally I think these answers are very interesting and can be really helpful. So bear with me about the outlook of the notes.
 Now the update includes chapter 6,7,8,9.
